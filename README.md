Project Name: Knowledge Hub

Everyone is aware of the hardships parents have to go through looking for a good tutor for their children. The job is hectic, time consuming and depressing as well, as spreading the word is not always enough for finding tutors. Knowledge Hub is the perfect platform for Parents. All they have to do is register and fill in the requirements, and they will be suggested with tutors.
The project is an online tuition provider, usable for the people who are in need of private tutors, and the tutors looking for students as well.
